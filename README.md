# Few-Shot Text Classification

This repo accompanies the Cloudera Fast Forward report [Few-Shot Text Classification](https://few-shot-text-classification.fastforwardlabs.com/). It provides small library to facilitate text classification using latent text embeddings with [Sentence-BERT](https://www.sbert.net/) as well as a simple application to explore text classification in several limited-labeled-data regimes. 

The primary output of this repository is the Few-Shot Text Classification application, a prototype user interface for the latent text embedding classification method. It includes the ability to apply various models for both on-the-fly and few-shot classification on the AG News dataset.

Instructions are given both for general use (on a laptop, say), and for Cloudera CML and CDSW. We'll first describe what's here, then go through how to run everything.

```

There are also `images` and  `tests` directories that are unimportant and can be ignored. Let's examine each of the important folders in turn.

### `apps`
The application accompanying this project comes with a launcher script to assist launching an [Application](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/applications/topics/ml-applications.html) with CDSW/CML.
To launch the applications in another environment, run the code inside the launcher file, with the prefixed `!` removed.
You may need to specify different ports.

### `cml`
This script facilitates the automated project setup on CML and is triggered by the declarative pipeline as defined in the `.project-metadata.yaml` file found in the project's root directory.


### `fewshot`
```
fewshot
├── data
│   ├── loaders.py
│   └── utils.py
├── embeddings
│    ├── sentence_embeddings.py
│    └── word_embeddings.py
├── models
│    ├── few_shot.py
│    └── on_the_fly.py
├── eval.py
└── utils.py
```
The `data/loaders.py` is used in all scripts and notebooks, containing code that returns a specialized `Dataset` object that makes it easier to handle the original text, embeddings, and labels simultaneously.  

The latent text embedding method relies on first embedding text with Sentence-BERT before performing any other steps. This code is found under `embeddings/sentence_embeddings.py`. More sophisticated methods incorporate word embeddings to augment the Sentence-BERT embeddings, and this code is under `embeddings/word_embeddings.py`. 

There are two regimes in which we perform text classification and we include a model for each. `models/few_shot.py` contains code to train a model that incorporates _some_ labeled data, while `models/on_the_fly.py` computes a model that performs classification with _no labeled data at all_. 

We also provide helper functions for generating predictions and computing metrics such as basic accuracy in `eval.py`. `utils.py` contains additional helper functions for I/O and serializing data.  

### `scripts` 

```
scripts
├── few-shot_text_classification.py
└── on-the-fly_text_classification.py
```
These scripts perform basic text classification for the various classification regimes and generate outputs that are used in the app. These outputs have been pre-trained and included with this repo. 

### `notebooks`
```
notebooks
├── CreatingRedditDataset.ipynb
├── Wmap_Experiments.ipynb
└── Zmap_Experiments.ipynb
```
The `Wmap_Experiments` and `Zmap_Experiments` notebooks walk through analysis discussed in the accompanying [Few-Shot Text Classification report](https://few-shot-text-classification.fastforwardlabs.com/) and are intended for interactive learning purposes. These work best when run as a [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) (rather than as a Jupyter Notebook) to take advantage of free GPUs. 

The `CreatingRedditDataset` notebook is included purely to document the steps taken when creating the **Reddit** dataset that we include with this module (located in the `data/reddit` directory.) It is not intended to be run directly. 

## Performing text classification in limited-labeled-data regimes
To go from a fresh clone of the repo to the final state, follow these instructions in order.

### Installation
The code and applications within were developed against Python 3.6.9, and are likely also to function with more recent versions of Python. We relied on GPUs for much of the analysis and use a version of PyTorch optimized for CUDA 10.2. 

To install dependencies, first create and activate a new virtual environment through your preferred means, then pip install from the requirements file. I recommend:

```python
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In CML or CDSW, no virtual env is necessary. Instead, inside a Python 3 session (with at least 2 vCPU / 4 GiB Memory), simply run

```python
!pip3 install -r requirements.txt     # notice `pip3`, not `pip`
```
---
#### Note on GPUs
The `requirements.txt` file installs a GPU-compatible version of PyTorch. If GPUs are not in your future, it might be prudent to instead install a CPU-only version of torch (which is more lightweight) with the following command: 

```python
!pip3 install torch==1.6.0+cpu torchvision==0.7.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
(Remove the `!` for non-CML/CDSW environments.)

---

### Data
We use two datasets in several of the scripts and notebooks, although the few-shot application currently only allows interaction with the AG News dataset. 

**AG News** 

This is a collection of 127,600 news articles in four categories. The [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news) is pulled from the open-source [Datasets repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets) maintained by HuggingFace. The `load_or_cache_data` function in the `data/loaders.py` file manages downloading this dataset on its first call, after which the dataset is cached and does not need to be downloaded again. 

**Reddit**

This [dataset](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-4508/) contains nearly four million preprocessed submissions and comments from Reddit, collected between 2006 and 2016. Like AG News, it is also [available](https://huggingface.co/datasets/reddit) on the HuggingFace Datasets repository, but it is **extremely large** and we do not recommend that you download it yourself. Instead, we provide curated subsamples of this dataset in the `data/reddit` directory, as well as a notebook (`CreatingRedditDataset.ipynb`) detailing how we performed the sampling. 

### Scripts / Notebooks
To fit models and perform text classification experiments, one can either call the scripts in the `scripts` directory, or walk through a more detailed process in the notebooks. Their functionality is as follows: 

* `scripts/on-the-fly_text_classification.py` performs **on-the-fly (zero-shot) text classification**; that is, text classification with *no labeled training examples*. This script generates a simple model (called a `Zmap`, stored in the `data/maps` directory) that is used in the next script as well as in the app. `Zmaps` are data-agnostic because they do not rely specifically on training data. We have already performed this analysis and include this output for you. A similar workflow is explored in the `notebooks/Zmap_Experiments` notebook. 

* `scripts/few-shot_text_classification.py` performs **few-shot text classification**; that is, text classification with *only a few labeled training examples.* This script generates a model known as a `Wmap`. `Wmaps` rely on training data and are thus specific to a given dataset. In the `data/maps` directory we include a `Wmap` trained on the AG News dataset, which is also used in the app. A similar workflow is explored in the `notebooks/Wmap_Experiments` notebook. 

To run scripts, follow this procedure in the terminal or a Session with at least 2vCPUs and 8GiBs of memory (and preferably a GPU):

```python
!python3 scripts/on-the-fly_text_classification.py
!python3 scripts/few-shot_text_classification.py
```
(Remove the `!` for non-CML/CDSW environments.)

---
NOTE: The scripts and notebooks were originally intended to be run on a GPU-enabled machine in order to complete in a timely fashion. On a CPU-only machine, they can take from 3-6 hours to complete. With GPUs enabled, this reduces to a few minutes.

However, we provide pre-computed data sources for the scripts so that they can be executed with only a CPU. The notebooks, however, require additional data sources that we do not currently include. These instead rely explicitly on GPU-compute to process data.

## Deploying on CML
There are three ways to launch this project on CML:

1. **From Prototype Catalog** - Navigate to the Prototype Catalog on a CML workspace, select the "Deep Learning for Question Answering" tile, click "Launch as Project", click "Configure Project"
2. **As ML Prototype** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "ML Prototype" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the repo URL, click "Create Project", click "Configure Project"
3. **Manual Setup** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "Git" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the repo URL, click "Create Project". Then, follow the installation instructions above.

## Additional information
### Tests

The `fewshot` module logic is partly covered by unittests.  To run all tests, use:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

We recommend running tests before committing any major changes.

The end-to-end test (`test_e2e.py`) will not work if files generated by `on-the-fly_text_classification.py` have not been generated.  (These files are checked in.)

### Formatting

We use black library to format code.  It is required that new changes to the library conform to this style.  To auto-format code, you can call:

```bash
./format_code.sh
```
